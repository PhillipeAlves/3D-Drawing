## The Project

This app is the result of an experiment I did about the dynamic generation of content using JavaScript to “draw” onscreen, using the transform properties of CSS. Inspired by stars in the galaxy, users choose a colour and draw their own nebula.

## Technologies

- JavaScript Templating
- CSS
- HTML
